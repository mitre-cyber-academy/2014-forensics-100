Description: User is presented an image that contains six other images within it. They will have to extract the images to find the key.

Solution: Most direct approach would be to use a hex editor and go through the image codes in order to extract images by finding the headers and pasting the hex into a new file. Note that the png is the one that has the solution. Another approach would be to use a file splitter.
